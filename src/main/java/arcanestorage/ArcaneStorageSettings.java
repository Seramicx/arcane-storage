 * out and loads them back, the same mechanism it uses for mod key bindings. So this is not settings infrastructure
 * invented here -- it is the engine's, and it costs one class and one method.
 *
 * <h2>Which side reads which setting</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code Settings.loadModSettings} is called from {@code GlobalData.loadGame(isServer)}, so <b>a dedicated server
 * loads this file too</b>, from its own config directory. That matters for what may safely live here:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Presentation</b> is read by whichever side draws it, which is the client. A mismatch is invisible.</li>
 *   <li><b>Reach</b> is read only where access is decided, which is the server. The client never checks it, so a
 *       mismatch can at worst put a wrong number in a tooltip.</li>
 *   <li><b>Costs</b> are read by both sides independently, and the engine sends no recipe data. A mismatch shows
 *       the client ingredient lists its server refuses -- see {@link CostTable}.</li>
