"""Bus names.

A device is really addressed by its coordinates, and coordinates are useless to a player: nothing in the game
shows a tile position, so "the bus at 1786,1912" identifies a device only to somebody willing to go and stand on
it. Names are the handle instead.

The name itself is only a label and nothing reads it to decide anything, so most of it needs no test. The number
in an assigned name does: it is chosen by looking at the network, and the obvious way to choose it is wrong.
