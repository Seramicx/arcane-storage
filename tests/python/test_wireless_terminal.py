"""The wireless terminal: a paired item that opens a network you are nowhere near.

What is worth testing here is not that a container opens -- it is that the *reason* the local terminal closes itself
does not apply, while every reason that protects a player's items still does. A local terminal container revalidates
every server tick and closes on distance, on the terminal being destroyed, and on any unit dropping off the network.
The wireless one must drop exactly the first of those three and keep the other two, because those two are what stop
a container writing into an inventory the world no longer owns.

So the distance tests below are deliberately paired: the same terminal, at the same distance, must stay open through
the wireless item and close through the tile.

**What these tests reach, and what they still cannot.** The harness runs one level with one player, so a network on
a level the server has unloaded -- read back off disk -- is still beyond them, and that half needs a human with two
levels.

The other half is no longer out of reach, and it was the half that broke. Regions unload independently of levels
and object entities live in them, so the case that matters is a *tile* that is not in memory, which happens on one
level with one player. The harness can now force it, so the tests at the bottom of this file cover what previously
took a human: opening a terminal whose region has gone, moving items through it afterwards, and a container
surviving the sweep that used to close it. The pin's regression test was checked by removing the pin and watching
it fail.
