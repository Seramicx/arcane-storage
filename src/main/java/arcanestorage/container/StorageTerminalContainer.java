    * <p><b>Also closes when any linked unit is destroyed, which fixes a real duplication
    * and loss bug.</b> The slots registered in the constructor hold a live reference to each

    * inventory</b>: withdrawing from it produces items the world no longer contains, and
    * depositing into it writes somewhere that will never be saved. Both were observed in
    * testing — an item appearing to duplicate and then vanishing.
    *
    * <p>Closing rather than rebuilding, because {@code Container} assembles its slot list in
    * the constructor, so a membership change cannot be represented in an open container.
    * This is also what vanilla does: every object container, from {@code OEInventoryContainer}
    * to {@code SignContainer}, closes when its backing object entity goes away.
    *
    * <p>Only removals are checked, not additions. Removal is the only way connectivity can
    * break, since objects never move — breaking a unit mid-chain removes that unit, which is
    * caught here. A unit being <i>added</i> is harmless: it simply is not shown until the
