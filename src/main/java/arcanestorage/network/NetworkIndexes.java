/**
 * The live {@link NetworkIndex} for each network, so devices on one network share one copy.
 *
 * <p><b>The point is not caching, it is sharing.</b> Two buses on the same network are asking the same
 * question about the same items, and before this each answered it privately: measured, five network walks and
 * two hundred slot scans per hundred idle ticks with two buses and one unit. Sharing makes the cost a property
 * of the network rather than of how many devices watch it, which is the property that has to hold before a
 * network can be worth building out.
 *
 * <p><b>Identity of a network.</b> A network is a set of connected units with no object of its own, so it is
 * named by its lowest-ordered member tile. Every device on it discovers the same set -- connectivity is
 * symmetric -- so they all arrive at the same name without agreeing on one in advance. Nothing is stored in
 * the world: a network that loses its last unit simply stops being named, and the entry ages out.
 *
 * <p><b>Two ways a shared copy goes wrong, and both are handled.</b> The layout can change, so any place or
 * break of a network object bumps {@link #topologyChanged()} and every index built under the old version is
 * refused. And the contents can change behind us, which until step 3's change hook lands is bounded by
 * {@link NetworkIndex#FRESH_FOR_TICKS} -- the same one second a bus already waited between recounts, so a
 * decision from a shared copy is never staler than one the old code made.
 *
 * <p>Server-side only. The client is told what to draw and never asks what a network holds, so an index on a
 * client would be a second truth with nothing to keep it honest.
