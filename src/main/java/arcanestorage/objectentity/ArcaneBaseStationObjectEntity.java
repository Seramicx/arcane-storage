/**
 * The Arcane Base Station: the one device on a network that generates a frequency band.
 *
 * <p><b>It holds no band state.</b> The band lives in {@link BandIndex}, the level's own persisted record, and this
 * entity is the thing that keeps it honest: it registers the band, decides once per layout change whether the band
 * transmits, and keeps its Access Points' regions in memory. Everything a player configures lives at the other end,
 * on the Access Point -- which is why this station's panel is a view rather than an editor.
 *
 * <h2>What has to be true for a band to transmit</h2>
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>A Wireless Transceiver on the station's own cluster.</b> The transceiver is the network's antenna --
 *       already, for the wireless terminal -- and the band is the same hardware pointed at the player's own
 *       outbuildings instead of at the player. Requiring it means the two wireless features are one investment
 *       rather than two, and it gives the station's sprite something true to be dark about.
 *   <li><b>Exactly one station on that cluster.</b> Two stations would mean two bands over one set of units, and an
 *       Access Point tuned to either would bridge the same network twice. Both go dark instead, for the reason a
 *       bus rule conflict stops both buses: a silent winner is worse than a visible refusal.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Both are read from a walk that <b>does not follow band links</b>. That is a hard requirement rather than an
 * optimisation: the walk that answers "may this band be crossed" cannot itself cross bands, or it would ask itself
 * the same question forever.
 *
 * <h2>Why this recomputes on layout changes only</h2>
 *
 * <p>Neither condition can change without something being placed or broken, and every network object already bumps
 * {@link NetworkIndexes#topologyVersion()} when that happens. So the heartbeat here is a long comparison, and the
 * walk happens on the tick after a change rather than once a second forever. An idle base costs nothing, which is
 * the property the whole mod is measured against.

    * with a transfer that copies nothing, which is a smaller price than a second upgrade path.
