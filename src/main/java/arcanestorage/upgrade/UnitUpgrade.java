/**
 * Upgrading a placed unit to the next tier without picking it up.
 *
 * <p>The reason this exists as its own class rather than living on the object is that <b>the whole value of
 * it is the ordering</b>, and ordering is easier to defend when it is written down once, in one method, with
 * nothing else in the file to distract from it. Crafting the next tier already works; what it costs a player
 * is emptying a unit first, and a storage mod that asks the player to move forty stacks by hand to grow a
 * container has not solved the problem it exists for.
 *
 * <h2>Why the order is what it is</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code Level.setObject} destroys the old object entity: it calls {@code replaceObjectEntity} internally
 * whenever the object ID changes, which builds a fresh entity from the new object and drops the old one from
 * the manager. The old inventory is <b>not</b> emptied onto the ground first -- verified by reading
 * {@code ObjectRegionLayer.setObjectByRegion}, which touches wires, lighting, settlement rooms and level jobs
 * but never the entity's contents. So the engine neither loses the items for us nor saves them for us: between
 * that call and the refill, the only copy of the player's belongings is the array on this stack.
 *
 * <p>Which fixes the sequence:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Validate everything first.</b> A missing material, a top-tier unit or an unregistered target
 *       returns before anything has been mutated, so the common failure costs the player nothing.
 *   <li><b>Consume the materials, then snapshot.</b> This order is not interchangeable -- materials may be
 *       stored <i>in the unit being upgraded</i>, so a snapshot taken first would restore the very bars that
 *       were just spent and hand out a free upgrade.
 *   <li><b>Swap the object.</b> One call, nothing between it and the refill.
 *   <li><b>Refill by exact slot index.</b> Not {@code addItem}: slot order is preserved so nothing appears to
 *       shuffle, and stacks are never merged or split, which is what keeps per-stack data intact.
 *   <li><b>Anything that cannot be placed is dropped as a pickup.</b>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Capacity only ever grows, so step 5 is unreachable by construction -- a 40-slot inventory always fits in
 * an 80-slot one. It is written anyway because "unreachable" is a claim about today's tier table, and the cost
 * of being wrong is a player's chest evaporating. <b>Items on the floor are a bug report; items gone are an
 * uninstall.</b>
 *
 * <h2>Modded items</h2>
 *
 * <p>The refill moves the {@link InventoryItem} references themselves, not a description of them. Nothing is
 * reconstructed from a string ID and a count, so enchantments, durability, and any custom data another mod
 * hangs off an item survive because they were never examined in the first place. An upgrade cannot understand
 * a modded item wrongly if it never tries to understand it.
