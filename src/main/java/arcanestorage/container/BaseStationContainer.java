/**
 * The Base Station's panel: a view of the band's channels, and nothing to change.
 *
 * <p>No slots, and one action: a way into the upgrade panel. Everything the panel draws arrives with the object
 * entity's own sync, so there is no open payload either -- see {@link ArcaneBaseStationObjectEntity#getRows()}.
 *
 * <p>The upgrade action exists because right-clicking a station opens this list rather than the upgrade panel that a
 * unit or a transceiver opens, so without a button here the only route to the next rung would be breaking the station
 * -- which takes the band and every channel on it. Reusing the upgrade panel rather than putting a cost display here
 * keeps one place that knows what an upgrade costs and what to say when it is refused.
 *
 * <p>Read-only is a design decision rather than a stage of construction. A channel belongs to the Access Point that
 * claimed it, and the Access Point is the device standing next to the storage it speaks for; moving those controls
 * here would let a player rewire a silo they cannot see, and the refusal messages -- out of range, channel taken --
 * would be about a place they are not standing. The station answers "what is on my band", which is the question you
 * walk to a station to ask.
