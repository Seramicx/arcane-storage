/**
 * A button that opens a themed panel of independent tickboxes, rather than a single choice.
 *
 * <h2>Why not {@link ArcaneDropdown}</h2>
 *
 * {@code ArcaneDropdown} answers "which one", and closes itself the instant a choice is made --
 * {@code choose} calls {@code openMenu.remove()} on every selection, because a single-select menu has
 * nothing left to show once its one answer changed. Multi-select needs the opposite: choosing an
 * option should never close the panel, or a player ticking three sources back-to-back would have to
 * reopen the menu twice. Bending the single-select class to not-close-on-choose would leave a
 * {@code SelectionFloatMenu} built entirely around delivering one value out through {@code choose},
 * which the caller here has no use for -- rows tick their own boxes and tell the caller directly, the
 * same shape {@link necesse.gfx.forms.components.FormCheckBox#onClicked} already has everywhere else
 * in the game.
 *
 * <p>Right-click is the escape hatch back to "which one": it checks that row alone and clears every
 * other tick, without closing the panel. Left-click stays independent multi-select.
 *
 * <h2>What this is built from instead</h2>
 *
 * {@link FormFloatMenu} wraps an arbitrary {@link Form} as a floating panel and only removes itself on
 * a click that lands outside that form -- ticking a box inside it is a click that lands *inside*, so
 * the panel survives it for free, with no override needed. The panel {@code Form} keeps its own
 * default background and edge (unlike {@link CategoryTreeForm}, which turns both off), because here
 * there is exactly one panel per open menu rather than one nested per category, so the "boxed tile"
 * look this mod avoids elsewhere is correct here -- it is what tells a player where the floating panel
 * ends.
 *
 * <p>Getting that panel themed needs two separate things, not one. {@code form.inheritStyle(this.parent)},
 * done by {@code FormFloatMenu.setForm}, covers every {@link FormComponent}-driven draw inside the panel
 * (the checkbox rows' own text color, most notably) -- <b>provided the rows are added after that call,
 * not before</b>, since {@code inheritStyle} only fires when a component is added to a parent (see
 * {@code ComponentList.add}) and copies the parent's *current* style; a panel built row-first and
 * wrapped second would freeze every row on the ungrouped default the same way {@link CategoryTreeForm}
 * once did. It does <b>not</b> cover the panel's own background and edge, though: {@code Form.draw}
 * paints those from {@code this.background}, a {@link necesse.gfx.GameBackground} field, entirely
 * independent of {@code FormComponent.style}/{@code getInterfaceStyle} -- {@link ArcanePanel#of()}
 * reads the mod's own ambient {@code ArcaneStyles.current()} rather than anything inherited, which is
 * exactly why {@code setBackground(ArcanePanel.of())} needs its own explicit call here, the same one
 * {@code StorageTerminalContainerForm.styled(Form)} already makes for every tab root.
 *
 * <h2>Row width: fit the label, capped, and clipped rather than wrapped</h2>
 *
 * {@link FormCheckBox#setText} wraps onto a second line whenever a label does not fit its {@code
 * maxWidth} -- correct for prose, wrong for a station name, which reads worse split across two lines
 * than cut off on one. Rows are therefore built with {@code maxWidth = -1} (never wraps, always a
 * single line at its natural width), and the panel is sized to the *widest* row's measured text --
 * capped, so one absurdly long name cannot blow the panel past what looks like a dropdown -- up to
 * twice this button's own width. A {@link Form} clips its children to its own bounds by default
 * ({@code shouldLimitDrawArea}), so a label that still exceeds the cap draws past the panel's right
 * edge and is cut off there rather than wrapping, which is the "clipped after that" the cap implies.
 *
 * <p>The button itself is a plain {@link FormTextButton}, themed the same way every other button in
 * this mod is -- through {@code inheritStyle}, set up the instant this component is added to a styled
 * parent, same as {@link ArcaneDropdown}.
