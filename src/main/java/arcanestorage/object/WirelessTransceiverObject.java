/**
 * The placeable Wireless Transceiver: the tile a wireless terminal is paired to, and the only part of a network
 * that a terminal can reach from outside.
 *
 * <h2>Why pairing moved here from the Storage Terminal</h2>
 *
 * <p>A wireless terminal used to pair to a placed Storage Terminal, which made remote access free with the mod's
 * entry-level object and gave the feature nothing of its own to upgrade. Pairing to a transceiver instead puts the
 * reach on a device the player builds, tiers and positions deliberately -- and it means <b>one network reaches as
 * far as its transceiver</b>, rather than as far as whichever terminal happened to be clicked.
 *
 * <p>Only the paired transceiver counts. A network may hold several without them combining or competing: each is
 * an independent door into the same storage, and the terminal in the player's hand names which one it uses. That
 * is deliberately unlike the unit ladder, where more units mean more capacity -- a second door does not make a
 * building bigger.
 *
 * <h2>Extending the chest base class</h2>
 *
 * <p><b>It conducts</b>, unlike the terminal and like everything else this mod places. That was wrong at first, for
 * the same reason it was wrong on the buses: a device that does not conduct <i>severs</i> a run, so a transceiver
 * placed between two units silently split the network and the units beyond it vanished from the terminal. A terminal
 * is a window and may sever nothing because nothing is expected to route through a window; a transceiver is
 * infrastructure and is routed through on purpose -- an Arcane Base Station has to be able to see it.
 *
 * <p>Same reason the Storage Terminal does: sprite handling, collision, damage, and dropping itself when broken all
 * come free. Its inventory is empty by construction ({@link WirelessTransceiverObjectEntity#SLOTS}), so the
 * drop-contents behaviour has nothing to drop.

   /**
    * Right-clicking opens the upgrade panel, exactly as a tiered unit does -- unless the click is a
    * wireless terminal pairing to this transceiver, which takes over instead.
    *
    * <p><b>Why the check runs here rather than in the item.</b> A wireless terminal item used to claim
    * every right-click for itself via {@code overridesObjectInteract() == true}, unconditionally --
    * fixed once already, but wrongly, at the item level: an item cannot see what tile is under the
    * cursor from that method's own signature ({@code overridesObjectInteract(Level, PlayerMob,
    * InventoryItem)} takes no coordinates), so it could not be selective about which tile it was
    * allowed to swallow. It could only be all-or-nothing, and all-or-nothing was the original bug --
    * a held wireless terminal opened itself instead of whatever chest or terminal the player actually
    * clicked on.
    *
    * <p>The engine's own dispatch order in {@code PlayerMob.runClientInteract} already does the right
    * thing once the item stops overriding it: an object at the clicked tile gets first refusal, and an
    * item is only asked when no object claimed the click. That correctly restores chests and terminals
    * taking priority. The one place that breaks is this object, because a transceiver both (a) is
    * always an interactable object standing at its own tile, so the item is never asked at all when a
    * transceiver is clicked, yet (b) needs the item's own pairing behaviour to run instead of the
    * upgrade panel precisely when a wireless terminal is what is doing the clicking. So the check moves
    * to the one place that already knows both things: this method receives the tile for free, and
    * {@code player.getSelectedItem()} is enough to see what is doing the clicking.
