/**
 * A dropdown whose open menu is drawn with the mod's own theme rather than the game's global one.
 *
 * <h2>The gap this closes</h2>
 *
 * {@link ArcaneStyles} documents two things {@code overrideStyle} does not reach. This is a third, and it was
 * visible in play: the dropdown *button* is themed, because {@code FormDropdownSelectionButton.draw} asks
 * {@code getInterfaceStyle()} for its art, but the panel that opens below it stayed base-game wood in every theme.
 *
 * <p>The cause is one hardcoded line. The open panel is a {@link SelectionFloatMenu}, built by the private
 * {@code OptionsList.getMenu} as {@code new SelectionFloatMenu(button, SelectionFloatMenu.Solid(...), minWidth)},
 * and {@code Solid} reads {@code Settings.UI.selectionBox} -- the global style, not the component's. So the menu
 * could not follow a scoped style however the button was configured.
 *
 * <p>No new art was needed: {@code selectionbox.png}, {@code selectionbox_highlighted.png} and
 * {@code selectionbox_inactive.png} already shipped in both style sets and had simply never been reachable.
 *
 * <h2>Why a subclass and not a patch</h2>
 *
 * The obvious alternative was a {@code @ModMethodPatch} on {@code getMenu}, or on the {@code SelectionFloatMenu}
 * constructor, swapping the style when the parent component carries one of ours. It was rejected: {@code getMenu}
 * is a private method of a private inner class, which is the most fragile target a patch can bind to, and the mod
 * loader does not stop a mod built for one game version from loading on the next -- {@code ModProvider} only
 * colours the version label red. A patch that stopped binding would therefore reach players as a fault rather
 * than as a missing feature, and all of this is cosmetic.
 *
 * <p>{@code clickHandler} is a protected, non-final field, so replacing the open behaviour needs no patching at
 * all. Everything else here is public API: the {@link SelectionFloatMenu} constructor takes a style, and
 * {@code add} accepts both entries and submenus.
 *
 * <h2>Consequence for callers</h2>
 *
 * The inherited {@code options} field is <b>not used</b> and populating it does nothing, because its option
 * containers are private to the engine class and cannot be read back out. Use {@link #choices} instead, which
 * mirrors the same {@code add} / {@code addSub} shape. The inherited field cannot be hidden, so this is the one
 * trap in the class.

   /**
    * A selection menu that draws with the component's interface style instead of the player's global one.
    *
    * <h2>Why it is done by swapping a static field, which deserves an explanation</h2>
    *
    * The engine's intended answer is a {@code SelectionFloatMenuStyle}, and the constructor accepts one, so the
    * obvious implementation is to write a style that reads {@code owner.getInterfaceStyle()}. That cannot be
    * compiled. {@code SelectionFloatMenuStyle} is a public abstract class whose {@code drawListBackground} and
    * {@code drawListBackgroundEdge} both take a {@code SelectionFloatMenu.SelectionBoxList} -- a <b>private</b>
    * inner class. The type is unnameable outside {@code SelectionFloatMenu}, so no code outside that file can
    * implement the abstract class. It is public in name only, and every menu in the game therefore draws with
    * {@code Solid}, which reads the global {@code Settings.UI}.
    *
    * <p>What is left is to make {@code Settings.UI} be our style for exactly as long as this menu is drawing.
    * {@code draw} is public and not final, so no bytecode patching is needed, and the alternatives were all worse:
    * patching the private {@code OptionsList.getMenu} binds to the most fragile target available and would still
    * hit the same unimplementable interface; and reimplementing {@link necesse.gfx.forms.floatMenu.FloatMenu}
    * means hand-writing hit testing, dismissal and nesting to change a background.
    *
    * <p>Three things make the swap safe rather than merely short. Drawing is single threaded, so nothing else
    * reads the field during the call. The previous value is restored in a {@code finally}, so an exception
    * mid-draw cannot leave the game wearing this mod's skin. And the previous value is saved rather than assumed,
    * which is what makes nesting work: {@code draw} calls {@code subMenu.draw} virtually, so a submenu built by
    * {@link #buildMenu} swaps and restores inside the parent's own swap.
