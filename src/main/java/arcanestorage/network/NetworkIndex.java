/**
 * What one network holds, as one shared copy.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this exists.</b> Every device used to count for itself: a bus asked "how many stone does the
 * network hold" once per slot it looked at, and each of those questions walked every unit's every slot. With
 * two buses and one full unit that measured 200 slot scans and 5 network walks per hundred idle ticks, and it
 * grew with the product of devices and slots rather than with either. The counting is not the fault -- asking
 * the same question repeatedly is. So the answer is computed once per network and shared, which is also what
 * the transfer resolver needs: a single canonical copy of derived state that a changeset can be planned
 * against.
 *
 * <p>Vanilla keeps such an index too, in {@code SettlementStorageIndex} and its four registered kinds, which
 * is the precedent for the shape rather than an implementation to reuse -- those are keyed for settler queries
 * and populated from settlement data.
 *
 * <p><b>It is a cache of state we do not own.</b> A chest belongs to the world, and anything may put items in
 * it. This class therefore carries the tick it was built on and the topology version it was built under, and
 * refuses to be trusted beyond either. Step 3 of the resolver plan replaces the rebuild with incremental
 * maintenance driven by a change hook; until then the freshness window is what the buses already had, one
 * second, so nothing observable changes.
 *
 * <p>Counts are keyed by {@link Item} identity, not by string ID. Registry entries are singletons, so
 * identity is the same comparison the string was standing in for, without the hashing.
