/**
 * The terminal container, opened from a wireless terminal instead of from a tile in front of you.
 *
 * <p>A subclass rather than a second container, and it overrides four things: where its membership comes from,
 * what "still valid" means, keeping the paired level loaded, and mirroring slots to a client that cannot see
 * them. Everything else -- withdrawing, depositing, crafting, bus rules, all of the tabs -- is the parent's,
 * unchanged and unaware.
 *
 * <h2>Why it is registered separately from the local terminal</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code ContainerRegistry.registerOEContainer} funnels through {@code registerLevelContainer}, which
 * resolves the level as {@code client.getLevel()} on the client and {@code world.getLevel(client)} on the
 * server -- the <i>player's</i> level, both times. That is correct for every container in the game, which is
 * opened by touching something, and it is precisely what a wireless terminal cannot use. So this registers
 * through the plain {@code registerContainer} and resolves the level itself from the binding in the content
 * packet.
 *
 * <h2>What the server holds versus what the client holds</h2>
 *
 * <p>Server side, this is an ordinary terminal container: the real object entity, the real units, real slots on
 * real inventories. Nothing that moves an item ever touches a copy, which is the property that matters most --
 * a mirror that drifted would be a display bug, while a mirror that items were moved through would be a
 * duplication bug.
 *
 * <p>Client side, the units are stand-ins from {@link RemoteNetworkShape}: inventories of the right sizes, at
 * the right slot indices, filled by {@link SlotMirrorEvent}. The client can therefore compute the aggregate
 * grid, preview craftability and show installed benches exactly as it does locally, because as far as it knows
 * it is local.
