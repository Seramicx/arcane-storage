/**
 * Resolving a {@link RemoteBinding} to a live Wireless Transceiver, server-side, whether or not its level is loaded.
 *
 * <p>The binding names a transceiver rather than a placed Storage Terminal, which is the tile a player right-clicks
 * to pair. Everything below is unchanged by that: a transceiver answers the same network questions, because its
 * object entity extends the terminal's.
 *
 * <h2>Loading an unloaded level needs nothing invented</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link World#getLevel(LevelIdentifier)} already does the whole job: it asks
 * {@code LevelManager} for the level, and when that returns null it calls {@code loadLevel}, which reads
 * the level file through {@code LevelSave.loadSave} and finishes with {@code onLoadingComplete} and
 * {@code simulateSinceLastWorldTime} — so a level that has been asleep for a week comes back having caught
 * up on world time. If there is no file at all it generates one. There is no cache to consult, no
 * asynchronous handle to wait on, and no separate "is it loaded" question worth asking first.
 *
 * <p>That was worth checking rather than assuming, because the alternative designs all start with
 * inventing a persistence sidecar — writing the network's contents onto the item, or into world data — and
 * every one of those would be a second copy of items that already exist somewhere authoritative. A second
 * copy of a player's belongings is the one thing this mod must never have.
 *
 * <h2>Keeping it loaded is the part that needs care</h2>
 *
 * <p>Loading is not enough on its own. {@code Server} unloads any level whose
 * {@code Level.unloadLevelBuffer} passes {@code Settings.unloadLevelsCooldown} (30 seconds by default),
 * and unloading calls {@code world.saveLevel} and drops the level from the manager's map. A container
 * holding slots on that level's inventories would keep writing into an object nothing saves again — the
 * player deposits into the void and only finds out later.
 *
 * <p>The buffer counts up once per {@code Level.serverTick} and is reset to zero whenever a client is on
 * the level. Vanilla keeps a level alive by resetting it directly:
 * {@code ArenaEntrancePortalMob}, {@code AscendedWizardMob} and {@code ServerSettlementData} all do
 * exactly {@code getLevel().unloadLevelBuffer = 0}. {@link #pin(Level)} is that same one line, and it has
 * to run every tick the container is open rather than once at open time.
 *
 * <p>A consequence worth knowing rather than discovering: while a wireless terminal is open, the paired
 * level ticks normally, because {@code LevelManager.serverTick} ticks every loaded level. Buses keep
 * moving items, crops keep growing. That is a feature here — the network being watched is live, not a
 * snapshot — but it does mean an open wireless terminal costs a whole level's tick.

    * writes are a player's items. Regions are reloaded if they have gone, for the same reason: coming back is
    * better than a container that is half attached.
    *
    * <p>No reference counting, and none needed: the engine's mechanism is a countdown that anything may reset, so
