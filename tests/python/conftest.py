"""Arcane Storage's own fixtures on top of the harness's pytest plugin.

This mirrors the Java split exactly, which is a good sign the shape is right: the harness ships the
generic driver and knows nothing about storage networks, while this file supplies the vocabulary
that only means something here. In Java that is ``ArcaneStorageVerbs``; in Python it is this.

Note the two queries that deliberately shadow the harness's own. ``query item`` in the harness
counts one tile's inventory, which is correct for a chest and meaningless for a terminal, whose
number is whatever its network can see. Same for ``total``. The harness lets a registered
expectation replace a built-in for exactly this reason, and ``query`` follows ``expect`` in
honouring that.

# CONTAMINATION -- why three tests carry @pytest.mark.realtime
#
# Those three pass on their own and fail in suite order under detached ticks. That combination means state
# surviving between tests, not a wrong expectation, so the marker is a holding position rather than a fix:
# it puts them back on the clock, where the contamination is hidden rather than absent.
#
# It is hidden because of what the old execution model did by accident. Every harness command was marshalled
# onto the server thread and waited for the next tick, so a command cost 50ms and a fixture's seven
# placements spanned seven ticks. Anything the engine defers to a tick -- entity removal in particular --
# was therefore always processed before the next test's first placement. Detaching game time removes that
# free settling, and whatever was relying on it surfaces.
#
# One instance of the class has already been found and fixed rather than marked, which is the template for
# the rest: ``BusObjectEntity.assignOrdinal`` counted removed devices when choosing a bus number, so a bus
# placed in the same tick as one was broken took the number after it and a lone import bus came out called
# "Import Bus #2". That was a real bug, reachable in play by breaking and rebuilding within a tick, and it
# was invisible for as long as the harness happened to leave a tick between every command.
#
# So each remaining mark is a lead, not a limitation. The suspicion is the same deferred-removal shape.
