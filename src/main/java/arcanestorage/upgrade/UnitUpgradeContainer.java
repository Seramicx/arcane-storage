/**
 * The right-click panel for upgrading a unit in place.
 *
 * <h2>Why this pushes rather than polls</h2>
 *
 * <p>The panel shows two things that change without the player touching this interface: how full the unit is,
 * and how many of each material they can reach. Both are sums, and a sum has no slot to be synchronised with --
 * which is the whole difference between this and the terminal. The terminal's slots <i>are</i> the unit
 * inventories, so when one player deposits, the engine's own container-slot synchronisation delivers it to every
 * other player with the terminal open, and nothing in this mod is involved. Nothing in the engine syncs a
 * derived total, so this one is sent explicitly.
 *
 * <p>It is sent, not asked for. A timer would be either too slow to be honest or too frequent to be cheap, and
 * it would make this the one interface in the mod where a change is noticed because somebody looked rather than
 * because it happened. The change hook that already exists is enough: {@code Inventory.updateSlot} is patched at
 * every one of its engine call sites and reaches {@code IndexedInventories.slotChanged}, which is how a network's
 * counts stay correct in the first place. This class hangs off the same signal.
 *
 * <h2>What stops it becoming a flood</h2>
 *
 * <p>A single deposit of forty stacks is forty slot changes, and each one is a reason to redraw. So the signal
 * only sets a flag, and {@link #tick()} does the work at most once per tick -- and then only sends if the numbers
 * actually differ from what this client was last told. An idle network sends nothing, a busy one sends twenty
 * updates a second at the very most, and a change that cancels out sends none.
