    *
    * <p>So the question asked here is behavioural — does this station need to be somewhere? — and it
    * is answered from two places the game already maintains:
    *
    * <ul>
    *   <li>the {@link SettlementWorkstationObject} hooks above, because a station that keeps state has
    *       to override them or settlers could not use it correctly either; and
    *   <li>{@link GameObject#getNewObjectEntity}, because placed state <i>is</i> an object entity in
    *       this engine. Verified Aug 2026: all eight installable vanilla stations inherit the base
    *       implementation, which returns null, while {@code FueledCraftingStationObject} overrides it
    *       to create an {@code AnyLogFueledInventoryObjectEntity} -- so every fueled station in the
    *       game is caught by that half alone, including the Cooking Station, which overrides nothing
    *       itself.
    * </ul>
    *
    * <p>The honest limit: a modded station could keep placed state without touching either, and would
    * slip through. It would also be broken for settlers, which is the reason to expect the overlap
    * rather than to assume it.
    *
    * <p>This is also the seam where production stations belong when they are done properly: fuel,
    * crafting time and a request queue are a feature, not a slot. See the roadmap.
