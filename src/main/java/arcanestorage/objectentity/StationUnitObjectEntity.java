/**
 * Object entity behind a Station Unit — sockets for crafting benches, on the network.
 *
 * <p>The slots are the same shape as the ones that used to live on the terminal, including the rule
 * about what may go in them, which is reused from {@link StorageTerminalObjectEntity} rather than
 * restated. That rule is worth remembering: a bench is accepted only if it does not override any of
 * the hooks a station uses to ask where it is, because a station that needs its tile cannot be reduced
 * to an item in a slot.
 *
 * <p>What changed is where they live and how many there are. Ten slots on the terminal was a number
 * chosen to fill a row; a Station Unit makes station capacity a thing the player places and pays for,
 * the same way capacity already comes from Storage Units and reach already comes from conduits. Free
 * station access was the one capability that broke that grammar.
